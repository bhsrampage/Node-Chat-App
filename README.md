## Additional Notes

- If a user shares a file/folder to another user, any updates to the original file/folder will also reflect in the shared file/folder.

- If a folder contains a file which is deleted by the user, a prompt for updating folder will appear. On confirmation folder will be automatically updated.

- If a user(sender) tries to share the same file/folder to the same user(receiver) again, the user(sender) will be informed that he has already shared the file/folder with this user. So the user will not be charged for the transaction.
